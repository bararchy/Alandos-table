# Gargonia
## Overview
Gargonia is a priosn built on the ruins of an ancient dwarven city fallen into a huge mine.
The cirty fallen into a `2.5km`X`2.5km` crater and the fall awaken an ancient evil which slept under the mine.
Slowly the corruption sips into the above ground, making the whole vally dry and unlivable, the water is poison which dull the mind and slowly corrupting the drinkers.
The Oblisk is one of the only clues regarding the "thing" which dwell benith the ground, and the corruption which slowly takes everyone in the camp.
Strange dreams will start infesting the group every time they sleep.

## Places
### Main Camp
* Water is poisend with mind-dulling substence, the only source in the camp is the poisoned well, and, an out-of-prison source, the non posioned waters costs much and you can never be sure if you're getting what you paid for.
* This is the only source to buy any kind of equipment, smuggeled or makeshift.

### The Mine
* The crystals which grow in the mine are "mana-stones" a very rare crystal that in the hands of an artisen can become a basis for a powerful artifact, the reasons it isn't mined even though the prison is basiclly a work camp is that in it's raw form it's as useless as a pieace of glass
