### Gargonia

#### Overview
Gargonia is a prison built on the ruins of an ancient dwarven city fallen into a huge mine. The city fallen into a 2.5kmX2.5km crater and the fall awaken an ancient evil which slept under the mine. Slowly the corruption sips into the above ground, making the whole valley dry and unlivable, the water is poison which dull the mind and slowly corrupting the drinkers. The Obelisk is one of the only clues regarding the "thing" which dwell beneath the ground, and the corruption which slowly takes everyone in the camp. Strange dreams will start infesting the group every time they sleep.


#### Places
#### Main Camp
The water are poisoned with mind-dulling substance, the only source in the camp is the poisoned well, and, an out-of-prison source, the non poisoned waters costs much and you can never be sure if you're getting what you paid for.
This is the only source to buy any kind of equipment, smuggled or makeshift.
The corruption runs deep here, some creatures hide in their tents or broken buildings, never goes out into the light, they are disfigured and mutated from simple black patches to full on blisters and maws with teeth on every part of their bodies, the uncorrupted stay on the far side of the camp, or just away enough from the buildings to not get killed.
Food can be bought here by paying 1 pick per one serving of food, the food is foul tasting and will force the player for a constitution check of 5+, if the player fails he will puke it all (you suspect the food is dead people, and yes, it is)
The camp has 3 “layers” or factions, 1. Outer-ring 2. Inner-ring 3. Buildings
Each of the factions has succumbed into the corruption, it’s signs more severe the deeper the layers go.
#### The Mine
The crystals which grow in the mine are "mana-stones" a very rare crystal that in the hands of an artisan can become a basis for a powerful artifact, the reasons it isn't mined even though the prison is basically a work camp is that in its raw form it's as useless as a piece of glass.
On the first level of the mine Olio has a secret cavern, it has wind traps capturing moist from the air and saving them into bottles for safe-drinking, also some kind of edible fungi, it’s not tasty but it’s nurturing.
The mine has two levels, the entrance, and the “lower level”, the lower level has a small rotten lift which descend down for quite some time, taking the players from the dying light of day to the pitch dark of the underdark. Slowly they notice the crystals shine and provide a dim lightning that is more confusing than helpful.
In the lower levels there are a few enemies, the normal underground things, the lost creatures who tried to run away via the tunnels but succumbed to corruption, and the “Evil”, the “Evil” will be the boss fight of the mine, it’s a “Black Pudding”, and can be out-maneuvered to run away.
The lower levels also prepare the group for the “real world” with equipment and treasure so that they can survive the outside being basically hunted every step of the way.

#### The Abandoned Arena
In the north-eastren corner of the crater an old broken arena stands half sunken in the sand. The old gates and pillars still stand, but some have broken off, a skeleton of a huge serpentine creature lies across the still sands. 
Some creature (sand worm) lives under the sand, if the company traverse it they will need to roll a stealth check, if anyone takes lower than 10 the creature will come for them.
Glyphs decorate the ancient walls, there is a secret treasure to be found here, if the company will look around they can roll per and above 15 will mean they see a glimpse of shiny metal on the far east side, if they go there (beware worm) they will find a hidden box embedded in one of the pillars which will be either lockpicked open (12+), or forced open (15+) to reveal a shield, a breast-plate and a short sword.

#### The Graveyards
The graveyards spreads for a hundred square meters in every direction, two of them are present southeast and southwest of the crater.
In the night strange things roam the graveyards (undead skeletons and zombies)
Digging up the graves can yield treasure or undeath. (1-15 = skeleton, 16-19 = small treasure, 20 = unique item)

#### The Obelisk
The Obelisk is a powersource for the “gateway” which is the other way to get out of the prison, the gateway sits midway between the abandoned arena and the southeastern graveyard, the Obelisk can be “configured” to transport power to the gateway by using three stones which are missing, the missing stones are in the hands of the three leaders of the prison.


#### Story
The players will try and find the “man in charge”, they will talk around, until someone will take them to Lucilda, a tiefling rogue, who is in charge of the outer layer, she is proving quite resistant to the corruption, she will try and make the players drink from the water (insight 21 will reveal her intentions).
Either way she will tell the players that there are two ways to run away from the prison, one is through the mine,  the other is through magical means (portal, stones, obelisk).
She will give the players a task, if they want the stone, or an old map of the mine they will need to help with the graveyard issue, a month ago a necromancer was brought here, with his dying breath he commanded the undead to rise in the hopes they will attack the humans, but without a proper time to setup the curse, the undead just roam around at night and usually attack the outer layer of the main camp.
If they will find the source of the curse (an item? The necro body?) they can get either the stone or map.

* Quest 1 notes - Necro body if cut in half, buried in a mark tomb in both graveyards, they will need to talk around to find it, the marking is only visible in moon-light so they will have to do it in the dark, 3 waves of undead will attack at each graveyard with 1-3 zombie\skeleton. When finding the body parts they will see one half is holding half a scepter and the other is holding the other half, bringing those together it will re-attach and allow the user to summon a weak skeleton once a day.

When they bring Lucilda the proof (scepter) she wants nothing to do with it and will just thanks the players and give them the stone or the map.

The next part after that is either trying for the mines (almost impossible) or going for the next stone (longer but easier).

The next stone is in the hands of Caligan, orc berserker, he is in the middle layer of the camp, it will take smarts and directions from Lucilda to find him, he is deeply corrupted by the sickness, gaping teeth-full mouths open on his skin, hidden under a robe, he coughs black blood every few moments.

He will ask the players to help with an ancient orc ritual of his lost tribe, he will need the blood of a “sand-hunter” (ANKHEG), he thinks that by lifting the middle-ringers spirits using the ritual it will battle the corruption and will give them more time. He knows this sand-hunter lives in the abandoned arena.

Caligan will give them the stone after he has been given the ritual ingredients.


#### Uprising: 
From the moment Caligans ritual is complete the minds of the inmates will swivel around revenge and vengeance, it will slowly break the hold of the evil on them, but it will also start an increasingly violent reaction against the humans.

Stage 1. The bloody hand - on tents and rocks you will start see a print of hand, the handprint is red , blood red.
Stage 2. Strange gatherings of heated debates in the night, fires, open burning fires and chants.
Stage 3. Dead human guards are starting to be found, no one saw anything, no one heard anything, but near the lift guards begin to appear, dead.
Stage 4. Full riot.


#### The Buildings
The buildings are mid-center of the camp, there are three different buildings, inside are the victims of the final stages of the corruption.
Unlike the expected smell of death and decay the whole thing feel sterile and fresh.
The floor is shiny clean, the walls are sparkling, almost as if a whole cleaning crew is working on it non-stop.
After going into the buildings the group will slowly see black humanoid forms, the forms are flowing with each step, like a water elemental made of black liquid.
When they pass near one of them small mouths begin to appear on the “skin” nearest to the touching points.
Every step the forms take makes the ground sizzle, and a small wisp of smoke goes up from the steps.
This is why the place is so clean, the beings are made of acidic substance and they keep peeling layers off the stone.

#### The Nameless
Unlike the other rings, there are no individuals here, the creatures are all a single being, it’s the manifestation of the evil that lurks in the mines below.
The players might start looking around for a leader but each manifestation is the same, bigger, smaller, dwarf, elf like, they are all the same entity.
When confronted regarding the stone, a mental barrage of pictures will be visible for them,each one sees himself killing Calligan and lucilda and the whole camp full of those entities, Then a picture of an entity giving them a blue stone.

In this point there will be a full riot outside, fire burns, shouts, and an overall rage, this should make it “easy” to kill the leaders if the players choose to do so, or will make their escape from the whole situation via the mines possible.

If confronting either Caligan or Lucilda they will offer to join and help against the black ooze in the mine if the players will pass 10 on persuasion roll.
