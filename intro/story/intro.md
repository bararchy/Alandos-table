Alando's Table.

Alando's story is actually pretty boring, he was a human, he was in love with an elf. that elf was the daughter of the head of the grand academy of Kesand, the elf capital of Rothgar.

Alando was smart but the father of his beloved did not approve of their connection, he mainly thought that she can do better but Alando was very persistent, so the father invited Alando to his office and explained that humans and elves should not intermingle, overall trying to make Alando away from pursuing anything further.

Instead, this drove Alando to make a table, the table had names of multiple races in them and using multiple qualifications like strength, dexterity, bravery, magical abilities he summed up a number for each race, putting Humans in the top of the score.

Of course, his love's father did not care when Alando showed him the table and eventually Alando decided to move on. This is where the story of Alando ends.

--

The royals of Ethrall were always a sorry bunch when it comes down to kingdoms, shadowed by the riches of Hammerfall and the king of the iron hall, most of the sea trade was done in Kesand and the dwarven kingdom of Smolder-rock. 

But Ethrall's ruling family did have something going on for them, Prince Nureael, the prince was an example to everything which was good in humanity, smart, strong, kind and loved by the people, he opened trade routes and made pacts, some say he was a step away from vanquishing the dragon scourge of Everburn.

But our story is not about Nureael, it is about his much less successful younger brother Nethanel, Nethanel was not stupid, some even say he had an uncanny intelligence, but whatever he did ended up failing, some people are just like that, full of potential but doomed to fail again and again. 

They used to say Nureael was always trying to help his brother which only drove the younger sibling away and into a constant competition. After a last grand failure where the royal guard of Ethrall was killed to the last on an attempted suicide attack on the orcs of Mudpath their parents sent Nethanel to the academy of Kesand to try, if nothing else, to send the problematic prince away and allow Nureael to bloom without his failure of a brother.

A year or so went by, and then, in a random class about the history of the gray city Nethanel found something in his book, an old and crumpled scroll with a table on it, a table that explained to the young Prince exactly why he was better, better then his neighbors, better then the stuck up elves who roamed Kesand, better then those Orcs who killed his people at Mudpath, better then the rich dwarves from Hammerfall.

This was everything he wanted and needed, a proof that he was not a failure, a proof that ruling others was his racial birthright! 
From that day onward Nethanel was an exemplary student, he finished his studies in war and strategy and went back to his kingdom to spread his new ideas about who should lead the land of Rothgar, he would see to it the ancient human empire will rise again.

Five years later his seat of power in Ethrall was secured with his brother's death in Everburn, rumors say that some strange orders were given against the older brother's wishes. 

Seven years later new laws have been enacted, only humans are allowed after night in Ethrall, taxes on the non-human races, home owners and shop owners could only be humans.

Eight years later the purge of Ethrall began, including the human towns of Eltara, the gray city and two roads, lines were drawn, battles have rolled and the empire of Ethrall rose to power over the region.

This is where you begin your journey, on a cage cart, on your way as prisoners to the hellhole prison of Gargonia, the new relocation camp for non-humans who survived the purge. It has been two days since you were captured and collared with the magic canceling devices.

The sky above are gray and sad, the crater of Gargonia brown and devoid of life, what would you do?
